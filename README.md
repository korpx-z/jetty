### This image is built to run on s390x architecture.
-    [build source](https://github.com/korpx-z/jetty) 
-    [original source code](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.docker)

### Versions
11.0-jdk11

# How to use this image.

To run the default Jetty server in the background, use the following command:

```console
$ docker run -d jetty
```

You can test it by visiting `http://container-ip:8080` or `https://container-ip:8443/` in a browser. To expose your Jetty server to outside requests, use a port mapping as follows:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 jetty
```

This will map port 8080 inside the container as port 80 on the host and container port 8443 as host port 443. You can then go to `http://host-ip` or `https://host-ip` in a browser.

## Environment

The default Jetty environment in the image is:

	JETTY_HOME    =  /usr/local/jetty
	JETTY_BASE    =  /var/lib/jetty
	TMPDIR        =  /tmp/jetty

## Configuration

The configuration of the Jetty server can be reported by running with the `--list-config` option:

```console
$ docker run -d jetty --list-config
```

Configuration such as parameters and additional modules may also be passed in via the command line. For example:

```console
$ docker run -d jetty --module=jmx jetty.threadPool.maxThreads=500
```

To update the server configuration in a derived Docker image, the `Dockerfile` may enable additional modules with `RUN` commands like:

```Dockerfile
FROM jetty

RUN java -jar "$JETTY_HOME/start.jar" --add-to-startd=jmx,stats
```

Modules may be configured in a `Dockerfile` by editing the properties in the corresponding `/var/lib/jetty/start.d/*.ini` file or the module can be deactivated by removing that file.

### JVM Configuration

JVM options can be set by passing the `JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable to the container. For example, to set the maximum heap size to 1 gigabyte, you can run the container as follows:

```console
$ docker run -e JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx1g" -d jetty
```


## HTTP/2 Support

Starting with version 9.3, Jetty comes with built-in support for HTTP/2. However, due to potential license compatiblity issues with the ALPN library used to implement HTTP/2, the module is not enabled by default. In order to enable HTTP/2 support in a derived `Dockerfile` for private use, you can add a `RUN` command that enables the `http2` module and approve its license as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM jetty

RUN java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-to-startd=http2 --approve-all-licenses
```

This will add an `http2.ini` file to the `$JETTY_BASE/start.d` directory and download the required ALPN libraries into `$JETTY_BASE/lib/alpn`, allowing the use of HTTP/2. HTTP/2 connections should be made via the same port as normal HTTPS connections (container port 8443). If you would like to enable the `http2` module via `$JETTY_BASE/start.ini` instead, substitute `--add-to-start` in place of `--add-to-startd` in the `RUN` command above.

Once OpenJDK 9 becomes generally available with built-in support for ALPN, this image will be updated to enable HTTP/2 support by default.

# Security

By default, this image starts as user `root` and uses Jetty's `setuid` module to drop privileges to user `jetty` after initialization. The `JETTY_BASE` directory at `/var/lib/jetty` is owned by `jetty:jetty` (uid 999, gid 999).

If you would like the image to start immediately as user `jetty` instead of starting as `root`, you can start the container with `-u jetty`:

```console
$ docker run -d -u jetty jetty
```
